Description: Our project is a sprite based action-platforming game using texture and sounds
from the 1985 arcade game version of 'Ghosts N' Goblins'. By running the file
'GameRunner.java', a frame will be opened and added to that frame, an instance of
'GamePanel'. From there, the player will be prompted to press the spacebar, and
the game will begin. The game is played using the arrow keys and spacebar, and
points are added to the score if the player kills a zombie. If the player is
hit once, they will lose their armour. If they are hit twice, the game will end.

Other Sources: Although most of the project was done from scratch, 
the file 'Transparency.java' was found online and copied directly. Here is the author and
link for the original file.
